						<p>David feels that these conference bios are a bit like online dating profiles. There’s a desire to seem interesting, not scary or too weird, and to suggest that this is somebody who you can tolerate for at least half an hour without you having to excuse yourself to the bathroom. So hey. How you doing?</p>

						<p>Oh, and he accidentally wrote a useful but dangerous little search/replace script that became crazy popular even though it was one of the smallest bits of work in his career!</p>
